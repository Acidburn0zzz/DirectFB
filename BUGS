automake/autoconf etc.

demo problems
-------------
- some demos work incredible slower with hardware drivers that do not support
  every blitting function (all except matrox) than with the generic driver. 
  This is because the surfaces are loaded into offscreen video memory, but
  cannot be blitted by hardware afterwards because of the non-supported
  blitting effects (modulation etc). All demos should query the hardware
  drivers' capabilities, and decide where the surfaces should go.
