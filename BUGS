automake/autoconf etc.
----------------------
- while linking -ldl is repeated up to 12 times (looks silly)
- if host system is i386+ mmx support is compiled in, to allow cross
  compiling, mmx support should be compiled if target system is i386+


linking problems
----------------
- libdirectfb has to be linked against libm on some platforms
  (i.e powerpc) because of ceil() and floor(). this is not
  necessary on intel systems. We should either replace the
  ceil and floor calls with own functions or check if
  libm is needed in configure.in

        if host system is not intel "-lm" is added to LDFLAGS
	( we should rather implement ceil() and floor() )
        

demo problems
-------------
- some demos work incredible slower with hardware drivers that do not support
  every blitting function (all except matrox) than with the generic driver. 
  This is because the surfaces are loaded into offscreen video memory, but
  cannot be blitted by hardware afterwards because of the non-supported
  blitting effects (modulation etc). All demos should query the hardware
  drivers' capabilities, and decide where the surfaces should go.
