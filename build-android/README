Android Build
=============


Quick info

	Run
		./generate.sh
	to generate Android specific project files, then run

		ndk-build

	and

		ant debug

	to get an .apk in bin/.


This is at the very first stage, the apk will include dfbtest_fillrect,
nothing on screen so far, to be continued coming days...
