This is an X11 system in very early stages, it is not really usable yet. You
will have to set pixelformat=ARGB in your directfbrc, and your X server has
to run in 32bit (DefaultColorDepth 32).


BUGS
- occasional segfault during startup
- does not work with multi-application core

TODO
- support for modes other than ARGB
- code cleanup
