DirectFB README
---------------

   This is a developers release of DirectFB.

   DirectFB is a graphics library which was designed with embedded systems 
   in mind. It offers maximum hardware accelerated performance at a minimum 
   of resource usage and overhead. 

   Check http://www.directfb.org/ for more and uptodate infos.


Requirements
------------

   - Linux kernel 2.4.x with framebuffer device support compiled in(*)
   - freetype 2.0.1
   - libpng2
   - libjpeg62
   - zlib


Additional Requirements for some Demos
--------------------------------------

   - PS/2 mouse for windowing, USB and ADB mice also work via PS/2 emulation.
     Please stop gpm before using the mouse in DirectFB.
   - Video card supported by video4linux for df_video
   - A very recent version of avifile is required to build an optional AVI 
     videoprovider; enable building it by passing --enable-avifile to 
     configure.
   - Joystick for df_joystick


   For mode switching a special fbdev driver for the graphics card must be 
   compiled in, generic vesa fbdev driver does not support mode switching.
   However if you use vesafb, you should add the following to /etc/lilo.conf:

	append="video=vesa:ywrap,mtrr"

   'ywrap' enables panning with wraparound.
   'mtrr' enables setting caching type for the framebuffer to write-combining.

   If you use an ATI128 or a RivaTNT apply the corresponding patch in the
   'patches' directory to the kernel.

   If you have a Matrox G200/G400 you may try the highly experimental vsync 
   patch that enables applications to "idle wait" for the vertical retrace.


Recommendations
---------------

   To take full advantage of hardware acceleration, a Matrox G200 or G400 
   graphics card is recommened for this version of DirectFB. The drivers for 
   ATI128, Voodoo 3/4/5/Banshee and NeoMagic cards included with this release
   are work in progress and only yet support a subset of the possible 
   accelerations.


Installation
------------

   1) In the DirectFB directory type:

	./configure
	make
	make install (as superuser)

   2) Make sure that /usr/local/lib is listed in your /etc/ld.so.conf.
      If you added it you have to run 'ldconfig' as superuser.

   3) Copy fb.modes to /etc or merge it with your existing /etc/fb.modes file. 
      The first entry will be used by default - copy other entries as you may 
      need.


Demos
-----

   After installation the following demos can be run (must be root):

   df_andi    - penguin demo, press space to form convergence logo, 
   	     	s/d to spawn/destroy a penguin, r to revive penguin
                after space was pressed, c tests clipping

   df_dok     - the DirectFB benchmark application, runs some tests and 
		displays benchmark results afterwards

   df_window  - simple demostration of the DirectFB window stack,
   	        follow the instructions in the upper left corner
       		(look into the source to enable the videowindow)

   df_particle - a moving fountain consisting of alphablended rectangles,
		nice and fast if hardware accelerated

   df_video_partice - same as df_particle, but the rectangles have been
  		replaced by a video (via video4linux). nice color effects.

   df_porter  - shows porter/duff blending rules

   df_video   - shows window stack with alpha blending and video playback in 
		a moving window

   df_joystick - colored version of df_particle, fointain can be moved with 
		joystick, particles of different colors can be spawned with 
		different joystick  buttons (1-4)

   df_neo     - port from a gdk-pixbuf demo to DirectFB, uses scaling, alpha
   	      	blending and color modulation; use cursor keys and space to
	 	change parameters

   df_fire    - the famous fire effect ported to DirectFB (16 bpp only)

   df_stress  - stress tests surface manager, for debugging purposes only


Dokumentation
-------------

   A complete API reference documentation in HTML format is created during 
   the build in the docs directory.
