This package provides the directfb libraries as found in the
debian-installer. You need it, when you want to develop udebs dependant
on libdirectfb.

Since this package depends on the "normal" libdirectfb-dev package
you need to tell the linker explicitly when to link against this
version of libdirectfb. You can do this by two means:

1) This package provides a pkgconfig directory:
   /usr/lib/udeblib/pkgconfig
   Use this pkgconfig by setting PKG_CONFIG_PATH to the above directory

2) Before building set LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib/udeblib. In some
   cases this is the only way to get the linker to link against this
   library, solution 1) can fail sometimes.

After building check if your programs have been linked correctly
against libdirectfb-udeb by running ldd $YOUR_PROGRAM and checking if
the linked directfb library contains the string "udeb".
