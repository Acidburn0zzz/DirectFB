Sorted by priority (any release)
---------------------------------

Finish CLUT/ALUT support.

Finish implementation of cooperative levels.

Finish display layer core and driver API.
 - Finish reallocate_surface() in src/core/layers.c
 - Link a layer's surface to the layer to avoid destruction
   if process that enabled a layer exits.
 - Disable a layer if it has been enabled by a process that died.

Finish multi application core.
 - Some messages may need to be dispatched synchronized
 - Add fork handling
 - Detaching foreign reactions from a reactor is currently
   not implemented.
 - dfb_surface_set_palette() installs a listener that needs
   to exist as long as the palette is linked to the surface,
   but if the process that did this call exits, the listener
   is dead, but the palette is still linked to the surface.
   The layer_surface_listener() currently does a workaround
   by attaching an extra listener (running in the master
   fusionee if it's the primary layer).

Finish surface manager.
 - Add kicking out a few smaller surfaces for a bigger one
 - Defragment free space

Module unloading.

SetVideoMode should resize the window for the primary surface
when in normal cooperative level and it already exists.

Add cooperative levels to input devices and implement
a grabbing mechanism for fullscreen apps running in
windowed mode.

Rework VT handling. Readd VT switching and Suspend/Resume.

Virtual window/layer resolution with scrolling/panning.

Rework cursor and palette handling in the window stack.
