- Added inputdriver for MS serial mouse. 
- Modularized inputdrivers.
- Even faster DrawString() software implementations.
- 32 bit aligning in the software driver resulting in a major speedup.
- New function Font->GetStringExtents.
- Use of antialiasing, kerning and hinting for fonts is now configurable.
- Support for interlaced PNGs (thanks to Johannes Zellner).

0.9.2
------

- Fix for loading jpegs unscaled into 24bpp surfaces
- 15bpp support for jpeg provider
- v4l provider support for devfs (/dev/v4l/video*)
- API change for DFBSurfaceDescription (pixelformat field instead of bpp
  field, removed DSCAPS_ALPHA.)
- DrawString() and GetStringWidth() support UTF-8 encoded strings now. They
  take an additional parameter that specifies the number of bytes to use from 
  the passed string or -1 for the complete string.
- Fonts are no longer loaded completely, instead glyphs are loaded on demand
  and are cached for later use.
- Font kerning tables are no longer loaded by the core.
- Removed default font from the core and made it a IDirectFBFont interface.
  Pass NULL as filename to CreateFont() to get the default font.
- Added MPEG video provider written by Kim JeongHoe based on libmpeg3.
- Performance improvements in the software functions for DrawLine(), 16 bit
  drawing functions and DrawString() in all depth.
- Added GetPos() and GetLength() functions to the video provider API.
- Use /dev/tty0 or /dev/vc/0 (for devfs) instead of /dev/console so DirectFB 
  works on machines with serial consoles.
- Removed dependency on libm.

0.9.1
------

- pkg-config files are available for optionally installed interfaces
  like IDirectFBVideoProvider_AviFile, so apps can test for their existence.
- Added IDirectFBInputDevice->GetButtonState() which returns the
  state of the specified button. GetButtons() is also still available.
- New demo called "df_knuckles" draws a three dimensional lighted skull
  that can be rotated by the mouse. (Port from Mark Vojkovich's DGA demo)
- Fixed accelerator ids in neomagic driver to match the ids in the
  current neofb kernel patch that is now included in "patches".
- Moved command-line parsing out of DirectFBCreate() into DirectFBInit().
  This means to inititalize DirectFB() there are now two calls necessary:
  DirectFBInit( &argc, &argv ); DirectFBCreate( &dfb );
- Added IDirectFBSurface->FillTriangle() for solid and blended triangles.
  Implemented in generic driver and Voodoo, Matrox acceleration.
- Interfaces with a reference counter of zero are automatically freed
  unless you enabled debugging during configure. In debug mode a released
  interface returns DFB_DEAD if a function has been called.
- Added Shockwave Flash Video Provider written by Joachim 'Roh' Steiger.
  You will need the libflash, that can be downloaded as a shared library
  from our download section. No modifications of libflash code.
- Added an option to directfb-config that makes "--libs" output
  the suitable LDFLAGS that are needed to have AviFile symbols resolved.
- Mouse cursor is no longer enabled by default.
- AviFile Provider now probing for ".asf" files, too.
- Fixed Stop in AviFile Provider, work around crashing AviFile call
  Player->Stop by using Pause and Continue. PlayTo can now be called
  several times without stopping to change the destination on the fly.
- V4L Video Provider no longer gets a NULL pointer as the filename,
  but "/dev/video0" and so on. Removed v4l code from core.
- AviFile Provider updated to compile with newest AviFile version.
- Implemented flipping of surfaces that are no window or layer surfaces,
  when the surface is a subsurface, a flipping region has been specified
  or the flipping flag DSFLIP_BLIT has been used.
- Improved documentation generator, a few parsing fixes.
- Added missing "void *callbackdata" to 
  DFBInputDeviceCallback and DFBVideoModeCallback.
- Some minor fixes and cleanups.
