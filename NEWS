0.9.7
-----

- Added deinterlacing for interlaced video sources to Matrox Backend Scaler.
- Added DSPF_UYVY and clarified description of both YUV formats.
- Added acceleration for Matrox Mystique, Millenium I&II, G100.
- Added support for YUV in V4L video provider.
- Added support for deinterlacing in df_layer example.
- Added option "--fbdev=<device>" to specify another device than "/dev/fb0".
- Added support for 'gsync true', 'csync high' and 'extsync true' in fb.modes.
- Added 8bit RGB332 pixelformat, implementation is not complete yet.
  If you want RGB332, you have to enable it using ./configure --enable-rgb332.
- Optimized RGB15/RGB16 color keyed blit (doubled performance on some CPUs).
- Allow RGB15 mode on fbdev drivers that report to use one bit for alpha.
- Fixed blocking of CreateImageProvider when called on /dev/video with BTTV.
- DirectFB now restores the palette during deinitialization, turns cursor and
  blanking back on and restores the terminal attributes like local echo.
  These fixes help a lot when using DirectFB with the option "--no-vt-switch".
- Updated NeoMagic framebuffer driver patch for 2.4.10 and above.
- Updated aty128fb framebuffer driver patch. The patch was tested with kernel
  versions from 2.4.7 - 2.4.12. It may work with older versions too.
- IDirectFBSurface::SetSrcColorKey has to be called on the source now,
  when blitting to a surface which has source color keying enabled.
- SetSrcColorKey and SetDstColorKey take three values now: r, g and b.
  They will be converted to the pixelformat of the surface automatically.
- Some minor fixes.

0.9.6
-----

- Added H3600 (ipaq) Touchscreen input driver.
- We now accept compatible pixelformats,
  e.g. IPAQ's RGB 444 format is compatible with RGB 565.
- Matrox Backend Scaler support as additional display layer.
- YUY2 format added for video playback.
- Added 'IDirectFBDisplayLayer::Set/GetColorAdjustment()'.
- Added simple layer example which plays a video onto the second layer.
- Added new window capability DWCAPS_DOUBLEBUFFER to create windows with
  two back buffers. This is useful for overlapping windows which both
  cause frequent updates of the window stack.
- Added 'IDirectFBWindow::Close()' that puts a 'DWET_CLOSE' event into the
  window's event queue. The event dispatcher thread can then decide to close it.
- Added 'IDirectFBWindow::Destroy()' which actually destroys the window after
  sending a 'DWET_DESTROYED' event, so the event dispatcher thread can notice
  and release any interfaces belonging to it.
- Added result 'DFB_DESTROYED' which is currently returned by 'IDirectFBWindow'
  and 'IDirectFBSurface' if the window or surface has been destroyed.
- Fixed surface manager bug causing inconsistency between video/system memory.
- More changes to surface manager fixing problems when using many many threads.
- Fixed segfault when loading big PNGs, seemed to be a problem with alloca.
- Minor fixes to window stack code.
- Some fixes to deinitialization code.

0.9.5
-----

- Added 'IDirectFB->CreateInputBuffer()' that allows to easily
  create input buffers for specific events.
- Added 'IDirectFBInputDevice->AttachInputBuffer()' to
  attach an existing input buffer to another input device.
- Added 'IDirectFBImageProvider->GetImageDescription()' to obtain information
  about alpha channel availability and possible color keys.
- New LIRC input driver, name your keys (lirc config file) like the DirectFB
  keycode enum does without the "DIKC_" prefix, e.g. "OK", "MENU" or "VOLUMEUP".
- First version of nVidia RIVA TNT/TNT2/GeForce driver (very limited right now).
- Updated kernel patches, improved synchronization for FBIO_WAITFORVSYNC.
- New pkg-config file "directfb-internal.pc" for better support
  for third party modules built outside the DirectFB source tree.
- You can move windows with the mouse when holding down CapsLock.
- Font width can now be set independent from height, e.g. for non-square pixels.
- Set gamma ramp, fixes "strange-colors-effect" with some framebuffer drivers.
- Accept interlaced or double scan modes, 320x200 looks really cool in some way.
- Deinitialization code cleaned up and reactivated.
- V4L capturing is now stopped by exit and signal handlers.
- Matrox driver cleanup and blending state fixes.
- More detailed generated API Reference (more comments in directfb.h).
- Many bug fixes, some compile fixes.

0.9.4
------

- Software driver pipeline optimization giving me 70% speed up for solid lines.
- Several bugfixes for image loading, Matrox driver, mode handling and more.
- Removed 'realloc()s' that caused callback functions to write into the
  old memory location if 'realloc()' returns a new one.
- API rewrite for IDirectFBDisplayLayer with new capabilities, e.g. flicker
  filtering, better configuration handling by 'Get/Set/TestConfiguration()'.
- Sub surface handling improved, especially for surface resizing.
- More safety and sanity checks and new error codes
  (DFB_MISSINGIMAGE, DFB_INVAREA, DFB_THIZNULL and DFB_IDNOTFOUND).
- Additions to IDirectFBVideoProvider: 'GetCapabilities()' retrieves info about
  the provider, 'Set/GetColorAdjustment()' set/get values like contrast etc.
- Cursor can be enabled/disabled and opacity can be set independently.
  Also cursor appears centered now.
- Experimental support for VT switching during runtime ;-)
- New command line option "--force-windowed" which already works with most of
  the examples, levels other than DFSCL_NORMAL give DFB_ACCESSDENIED.
- GIF loading to ARGB fixed, transparent GIFs are now supported as ARGB.
- Several fixes to video mode list and pixelformat handling in
  'read_modes()', 'fbdev_set_mode()' and 'fbdev_get_pixelformat()'.
- Added IDirectFBSurface->DrawLines(), used by df_dok now.
- Some optimizations in DrawString and core font handling.
- Fixed font problems with Matrox cards, their texture cache is flushed
  now after writing the glyph into the framebuffer (i.e. into the texture).
- Mouse cursor movements are now clipped by the screen ;-)
- Fixed 'directfb.h', identifier "id" was also a keyword in Objective C.
- Added IDirectFBInputBuffer->WaitForEventWithTimeout,
  was missing in last release.

0.9.3
------

- All modules (drivers/providers) are built conditionally, can be
  disabled. configure spits out a summary of all modules.

0.9.2
------

- Fix for loading jpegs unscaled into 24bpp surfaces
- 15bpp support for jpeg provider
- v4l provider support for devfs (/dev/v4l/video*)
- API change for DFBSurfaceDescription (pixelformat field instead of bpp
  field, removed DSCAPS_ALPHA.)
- DrawString() and GetStringWidth() support UTF-8 encoded strings now. They
  take an additional parameter that specifies the number of bytes to use from 
  the passed string or -1 for the complete string.
- Fonts are no longer loaded completely, instead glyphs are loaded on demand
  and are cached for later use.
- Font kerning tables are no longer loaded by the core.
- Removed default font from the core and made it a IDirectFBFont interface.
  Pass NULL as filename to CreateFont() to get the default font.
- Added MPEG video provider written by Kim JeongHoe based on libmpeg3.
- Performance improvements in the software functions for DrawLine(), 16 bit
  drawing functions and DrawString() in all depth.
- Added GetPos() and GetLength() functions to the video provider API.
- Use /dev/tty0 or /dev/vc/0 (for devfs) instead of /dev/console so DirectFB 
  works on machines with serial consoles.
- Removed dependency on libm.

0.9.1
------

- pkg-config files are available for optionally installed interfaces
  like IDirectFBVideoProvider_AviFile, so apps can test for their existence.
- Added IDirectFBInputDevice->GetButtonState() which returns the
  state of the specified button. GetButtons() is also still available.
- New demo called "df_knuckles" draws a three dimensional lighted skull
  that can be rotated by the mouse. (Port from Mark Vojkovich's DGA demo)
- Fixed accelerator ids in neomagic driver to match the ids in the
  current neofb kernel patch that is now included in "patches".
- Moved command-line parsing out of DirectFBCreate() into DirectFBInit().
  This means to inititalize DirectFB() there are now two calls necessary:
  DirectFBInit( &argc, &argv ); DirectFBCreate( &dfb );
- Added IDirectFBSurface->FillTriangle() for solid and blended triangles.
  Implemented in generic driver and Voodoo, Matrox acceleration.
- Interfaces with a reference counter of zero are automatically freed
  unless you enabled debugging during configure. In debug mode a released
  interface returns DFB_DEAD if a function has been called.
- Added Shockwave Flash Video Provider written by Joachim 'Roh' Steiger.
  You will need the libflash, that can be downloaded as a shared library
  from our download section. No modifications of libflash code.
- Added an option to directfb-config that makes "--libs" output
  the suitable LDFLAGS that are needed to have AviFile symbols resolved.
- Mouse cursor is no longer enabled by default.
- AviFile Provider now probing for ".asf" files, too.
- Fixed Stop in AviFile Provider, work around crashing AviFile call
  Player->Stop by using Pause and Continue. PlayTo can now be called
  several times without stopping to change the destination on the fly.
- V4L Video Provider no longer gets a NULL pointer as the filename,
  but "/dev/video0" and so on. Removed v4l code from core.
- AviFile Provider updated to compile with newest AviFile version.
- Implemented flipping of surfaces that are no window or layer surfaces,
  when the surface is a subsurface, a flipping region has been specified
  or the flipping flag DSFLIP_BLIT has been used.
- Improved documentation generator, a few parsing fixes.
- Added missing "void *callbackdata" to 
  DFBInputDeviceCallback and DFBVideoModeCallback.
- Some minor fixes and cleanups.
