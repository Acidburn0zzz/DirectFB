- This patch patches the aty128fb driver in linux-2.4.6 to benh's latest
  version + my fixes.

It fixes/changes the following:

- driver now supports RGB565 16-bit mode

- pannig works now, allows correct dublebuffering, without jittering screen.

- FB_ACTIVATE_NOW and FB_ACTIVATE_VBL are now supported, CRTC_OFFSET_CNTL
  register is set correctly. aty128fb only accepted FB_ACTIVATE_NOW before
  but acted always like FB_ACTIVATE_VBL.
  This fix eliminates flickering in DirectFB programs  (and other fbdev
  applications) when using doublebuffering.
