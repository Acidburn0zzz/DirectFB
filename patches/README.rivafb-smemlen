This patch fixes a potential bug in rivafb that may crash your card:
there are 128 Kb at the end of the framebuffer memory that must
not be mapped in user space.

Either apply the patch

	cd kernel-source
	bzcat rivafb-smemlen-linux-2.4.26.patch.bz2 | patch -Np1

or use the 'videoram-limit' option.
