This patch fixes/changes the following:

- driver now supports RGB565 16-bit mode

- pannig works now, allows correct dublebuffering, without jittering screen.

- FB_ACTIVATE_NOW and FB_ACTIVATE_VBL are now supported, CRTC_OFFSET_CNTL
  register is set correctly. aty128fb only accepted FB_ACTIVATE_NOW before
  but acted always like FB_ACTIVATE_VBL.
  This fix eliminates flickering in ClanLib (and other fbdev applications)
  when using doublebuffering.

- no more messed up colors in modes > 8 bpp. driver no longer uses hardware
  palette in modes > 8bpp, sets fbcon palette correctly instead. 

- removed powerpc mmio endian conversion, since it is already done by
  readl() and writel() kernel functions

without this patch games like ClanBomber are a mess and unplayable.
