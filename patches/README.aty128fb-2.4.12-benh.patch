This patch patches the aty128fb driver in the linus' kernel tree to the
version included in Benjamin Herrenschmidt's kernel tree.
I tested this patch with kernels from 2.4.7 to 2.4.12, maybe other
versions work too.

If you have a Power Mac and already use benh's kernel tree, you dont have to
do anything, DirectFB will just run fine.

It fixes/changes the following (for DirectFB):

- driver supports RGB565 16-bit mode

- pannig works, allows correct dublebuffering, without jittering screen.

- FB_ACTIVATE_NOW and FB_ACTIVATE_VBL are now supported, CRTC_OFFSET_CNTL
  register is set correctly. aty128fb only accepted FB_ACTIVATE_NOW before
  but acted always like FB_ACTIVATE_VBL.
  This fix eliminates flickering in DirectFB programs  (and other fbdev
  applications) when using doublebuffering.

- no more errors when using drm and starting DirectFB programs from X.
