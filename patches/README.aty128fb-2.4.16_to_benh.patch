I will remove this patch as soon as 2.4.18-final has been released.

This patch patches the aty128fb driver in the "official" 2.4 kernel tree to
the version included in Benjamin Herrenschmidt's kernel tree.

If you have a Power Mac and already use benh's kernel tree, you dont have to
do anything, DirectFB will just run fine.

It fixes/changes the following (for DirectFB):

- driver supports RGB565 16-bit mode
- pannig works, allows correct dublebuffering, without jittering screen.
- no more errors when using drm and starting DirectFB programs from X.
- correct colors when using XFree's "UseFBDev" option.
