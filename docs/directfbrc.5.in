.SH NAME
directfbrc \- DirectFB configuration file


.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.B directfbrc
file is a configuration file read by all DirectFB applications on startup.
There are two of these: a system-wide one stored in
.I /etc/directfbrc
and a per-user
.I
\fB$HOME\fP/.directfbrc
which may override system settings.

The same parameters that can be used in the
.B directfbrc
file can also be passed to DirectFB applications on the command-line
by prefixing them with 
.BR --dfb:


.SH SYNTAX

The
.B directfbrc
file contains one parameter per line. Comments are introduced by a
hash sign (#), and continue until the end of the line.  Blank lines
are ignored.


.SH PARAMETERS

The following parameters may be specified in the
.B directfbrc
file:

.TP
.BI fbdev=<device>
Open the given frame buffer device instead of /dev/fb0.

.TP
.BI mode=<width>x<height>
Sets the default screen resolution. If unspecified DirectFB will use
the first mode from
.I /etc/fb.modes
Some frame buffer devices (namely vesafb) don't support mode switches
and can only be used in the resolution that is set on boot time.

.TP
.BI depth=<pixeldepth>
Sets the default pixel depth in bits per pixel. If unspecified
DirectFB will use the depth specified in the first mode from
.I /etc/fb.modes
DirectFB supports color depths of 15, 16, 24 and 32 (support for 8 bit
can optionally be compiled in as well). What values are available for
you depends on the frame buffer device you are using. Some frame
buffer devices (namely vesafb) don't support mode switches at all and
can only be used in the pixel depth that is set on boot time.

.TP
.BI quiet
Suppresses console output from DirectFB. Only error messages will be
displayed.
