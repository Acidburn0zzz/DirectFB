.SH NAME
directfb-csource \- C code generation utility for DirectFB surfaces

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdirectfb-csource\fP [\fIoptions\fP] <\fIimagefile\fP>

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdirectfb-csource\fP is a small utility that reads a PNG (Portable
Network Graphics) image file and generates C code that can be used to
compile the image into a DirectFB application. The example below
illustrates this.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fI--name=identifier
Specifies the identifier name (prefix) for the generated variables.
If this option is not used, the identifier is generated from the
filename.

.TP
\fI--format=pixelformat
Specifies the pixelformat of the generated inline surface. Possible
values are ARGB, RGB32, RGB24, RGB16, RGB15 and A8. By default the
format is ARGB if the PNG image has alpha information or RGB32 if not.

.TP
\fI--version
Output version information.

.TP
\fI--help
Print brief help and exit.


.SH EXAMPLE
Generate a header file from a PNG image file:

	directfb-csource --name=foo foo.png > foo.h

Include the generated header in your application and create a
surface using the surface description from the header file.

  #include <directfb.h>
  #include "foo.h"

  IDirectFB        *dfb;
  IDirectFBSurface *surface;

  ...

  dfb->CreateSurface( dfb, &foo_desc, &surface );

That's it.


.SH OTHER INFO
\fBdirectfb-csource\fP was inspired by and uses code from
\fBgdk-pixbuf-csource\fP, a similar program written by Tim Janik.
